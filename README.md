This code aims to find the convective heat transfer coefficient from the fit of analytical models for the steady state heat transfer of extended surfaces (thermal fins).
Two models are considered:
  - fin with prescribed temperature at the tip and equal to room temperature; and
  - fin with adiabatic tip (isolated).
  
Both models have a parameter m, which is found from the best fit of these models to the experimental points (given by the input file)
Several figures are generated for the purposes of comparison between the experimental points and the models, and between the models themselves.
